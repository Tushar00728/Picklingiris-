# Picklingiris

* This program is a solution to an excercise from a youtube channel CodeWithHarry (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) from the playlist : Python tutorials for absolute beginners.
* This program basically takes in the data from the the famous UCI ML Iris dataset and pickles it into a .pkl as a list.
